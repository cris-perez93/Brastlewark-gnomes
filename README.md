# Brastlewark Api -

**Task** 

âœ… Task â†’ -Retrieve data from the URL. It is provided as an static json, but assume it might change randomly.
-Show this data in the most user-friendly way could you thiink. Keep in mind our heroes will be quite busy dealing wth Orcs, so the app has to be really simple and easy to use. At least, it would be good to quickly browse(and even filter) all the individuals and be able to see the details of each one.

## Estructure
I have followed an atomized structure in order to achieve an architecture
with small components, using a design pattern separating the logic from the visual component.
We get data and pass information-state through Redux , and pass props throught components, and document them with PropTypes.
