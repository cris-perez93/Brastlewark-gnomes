**Objetivos** 

âœ… Task â†’ -Retrieve data from the URL. It is provided as an static json, but assume it might change randomly.
-Show this data in the most user-friendly way could you thiink. Keep in mind our heroes will be quite busy dealing wth Orcs, so the app has to be really simple and easy to use. At least, it would be good to quickly browse(and even filter) all the individuals and be able to see the details of each one.
